# very Simple NodeJS Physics
This is a very simple nodeJS script designed to roughly simulate an object bouncing in a 1D/2D world.
<br/> Note that it has a lot of flaws and it is just calculating everything roughly, for example, E is not constant whilst free falling but it is in the real world.
<br/> performance may vary, weirdly, mostly based on what terminal you use
# usage of web mode
to use the web mode you have to set the "reportToWeb" to true, and it is recommended to set "drawCompatibleForWeb" to true.<br/>
you can also change the characters used to draw to whatever you want.<br/>
to access the output you need to run the file "SERVER/server.js"<br/>
then you can go to the URL "localhost:3000", you can change the port by changing it in both of the JS files.
